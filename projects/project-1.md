For a long time in my life, I've had a fascination with the history of the Pacific War. This has been augmented by how Pearl Harbor is within sight of my home at all times. At Leeward Community College, I took a drawing class to fulfill the arts requirement for graduation at UH Manoa. During my time there, I usually used the ship and aircraft models I made as subjects.  For my final project, we were supposed to use charcoal to create a drawing to the theme of "Inside-Out". For that, I decided to use two model aircraft: a U.S. Navy SBD Dauntless dive bomber and a Japanese Navy B5N Type 97 torpedo bomber. I also did a ton of research on the cockpit of both aircraft to create an accurate depiction of what the pilot would see inside the plane. For the inside of the dive bomber, I depicted the dive bombing run on the Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga. For the torpedo bomber, I depicted the torpedo bombing run during the Pearl Harbor attack against the battleship Oklahoma.
