# Once More, Unto the Breach

To be honest, after finishing Software Development I, I didn't plan so far ahead that I knew I would be taking Software Development II years down the line, especially since other classes held me back at the time. In the end, this class challenged my ability to create a website for a customer with specific needs, and not because I had to put project-based coding on hold for the past few years to focus on other classes.

## Where's First Gear Again?

It really has been a while since I last worked in a group to deliver a website. Only this time, that website has to be built to a customer's needs and demands, not the group's internal goals. The last time I worked with Meteor and Mongo was around 2019, which meant that my skills with those languages were a bit on the rusty side. All the pieces were there, though, so I just had to see what I did for the 314 class. The difference, though, is the presence of Bootstrap, which I had no experience using. It took a lot of documentation reading, but I managed to piece together some knowledge to get through it. That didn't stop me from messing up every now and again, but

## Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back

When we first started the project, we had thought that the customer wanted the website to be a scheduler. Something like a calendar that shows a room's availability over the course of a week. To that end, I was assigned to work on a date picker component so a user would be able to reserve the room for one reason or another. Visually speaking, the component was supposed to have a popout with a calendar on it and the user was able to select the date by clicking. From there, other components were able to use the data from the calendar component. To that end, I went out in search of a pre-made component or package that could be integrated into the project. The first one seemed straightforward, but unfortunately I couldn't seem to get it to work for some reason or another. This issue persisted for a few weeks. At least until I managed to find a different Meteor package that worked with the project that. However, then came time for the customer milestone. That was when we found out that customer didn't necessarily need a scheduling website, but one that kept track of the rooms, the staff assigned to the rooms, and the resources each room had. This meant that whatever was being worked on for the room requests would more than likely be scrapped. Whaich meant that the date picker I speent so much time on would be scrapped as well. It's honestly disappointing to know that it was all for naught but we all had to re-orient our goals to something closer to what the customer wanted.
