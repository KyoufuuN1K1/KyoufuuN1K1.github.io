  So far, Javascript seems like any other programming language, albeit with slightly different syntax. I’ve actually been out of practice in programming for a while, but I still managed to learn a lot from the FreeCodeCamp lessons. Most of it was a refresher, but it still helped nonetheless. One of the more difficult things in this was destructuring the Javascript code. I’m so used to long-form programming that destructuring the code feels like trying to translate Egyptian hieroglyphics. It may be easier and with less code, but there’s still a learning curve that I still haven’t quite grasped yet.
 
 Personally, I have never experienced athletic software engineering, so apart from practices, the WOD was a first for me. I will admit that timed practice would help me improve my programming skills, but I know that I’m not that good under pressure. Regardless, if I could program faster and keep my calm long enough to consistently type good code, it would be good in the future. Still, I know that this recent WOD was relatively simple, so it would be prudent for me to refresh myself on Javascript functions that I am able to use.

  After all that’s said and done, I do not yet believe I am familiar enough with Javascript to determine whether or not it is better or worse than other programming languages. I do know that I will need to practice more in order to actually be proficient in it. While my time fell around average, I completely forgot about functions and the like which could have allowed me to code faster.
