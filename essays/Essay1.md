title: Software Engineering? How?

In this software engineering class, my main goal is to be able to gain the skills to create games. For a long time, I’ve wanted to create video games, so to that end, I’ve been taking programming classes to learn how. My programming experience mainly falls under the amateur level, but I aim to improve enough to either get hired by a company or to start my own.
In the future of this class, I hope to learn how to program faster and more effectively. Despite how much I managed to program so far, most of my original code seems bulky and hard to understand. Moreover, the last thing I programmed, a program that outputs Japanese Morse Code, too far too long to program and still has many errors I have yet to correct. I am hoping that this class can help me improve that program and much more.
I also generally hope to develop my collaborative skills in general. Most of the time, I prefer to act solo, but that has its limits. Since the final project in this class is a group project, I aim to improve my group skills so I can use them later on, especially communication. It’s almost impossible to code an entire game by oneself, especially the multi-million dollar games one sees for sale in a video game store. By the time this class ends, I hope I would be much better at teamwork than I am now.
